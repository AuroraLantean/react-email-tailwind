## React-Email-Tailwind Error Demo App

## Install NPM Package Manager and this repo packages

See [PNPM installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)
Then install this repository packages:

```bash
pnpm install
```

[Notice] use @react-email/tailwind@^0.0.8 instead of @react-email/tailwind@0.0.9 for the ReactServerComponentsError

```bash
pnpm add @react-email/tailwind@^0.0.8
```

## Run the application

I use Bun to run the development because of its speed, but you should be able to use PNPM or NPM or Yarn to run it as well.
Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
Then run this app by:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
